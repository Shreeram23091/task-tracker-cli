# Task Manager CLI Tool

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application designed for managing tasks. Users can add, view, complete, and delete tasks, with all data stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) for persistence across sessions.

## Features
- **Add a Task**: Easily append new tasks with a description, marked as "pending."
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks, categorized into pending and completed.
- **Complete a Task**: Mark a specified task as completed.
- **Delete a Task**: delete a task from the list by its assigned number.

## Modules Used
- **`sys`**: This built-in module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It allows the program to read user input from the command line, facilitating interaction with the task manager.
- **`os`**: This built-in module offers a way to use operating system-dependent functionality, such as checking the existence of files. It ensures the application can load tasks from a file or create a new one if it doesnâ€™t exist.

## Installation

```
**Example Output**:
```
Pending Tasks:
1. Buy book

To mark a task as completed, use:
```bash
python task_manager.py complete [task number]
```

## Error Handling
If an invalid task number is provided for completing or deleting a task, the program will display an error message indicating that the task number is invalid.

## Sample `tasks.txt` Format
Each line in `tasks.txt` represents a task in the following format:
```
status, description
```
**Example**:
```
pending, Buy groceries
completed, Finish homework
pending, Read a book
```
